Every Mechanical Engineer has, at least once in his life, idolized Tony Stark and wanted to build an Iron Man suit with scraps from the garage. What I set out to pursue as a means to the end (the Iron Man suit!) has now become my life.

While my undergrad education helped me to hone my design and manufacturing skills - with several research-heavy projects in my junior and senior years - my Master’s education at Columbia University has proven to be invaluable. I’ve had the fortune to work on some truly ground-breaking and inspiring projects while meeting many influential and creative individuals along the way.

In my first semester itself, I’ve had the opportunity to take some amazing coursework and work on two projects that I’m the proudest of:

- Laika (the dancing robot) 

- Columbia Robotics Club’s proposal for the NASA Big Idea Challenge 2022.


In the current semester, I’m a Graduate Research Assistant at the Robotics and Rehabilitation (RoAR) Lab and will be working on robotic assistive technologies to help stroke patients and children with cerebral palsy.
I’ve also taken up courses like Robot Learning and AI to sharpen my skills in the field of Reinforcement learning and autonomous systems. The Human-Centered Design and Innovation course is focused on devising product designs with a more customer-centric approach, and I'm really excited for what lies ahead!


Feel free to reach out to me and talk to me about Robotics, Photography, Music and Harry Potter, among other things!
