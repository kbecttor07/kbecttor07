## ðŸ“– About
Iâ€™m a Graduate Research Assistant at the Robotics and Rehabilitation (RoAR) Lab and will be working on robotic assistive technologies to help stroke patients and children with cerebral palsy.
Iâ€™ve also taken up courses like Robot Learning and AI to sharpen my skills in the field of Reinforcement learning and autonomous systems. The Human-Centered Design and Innovation course is focused on devising product designs with a more customer-centric approach, and I'm really excited for what lies ahead!
## ðŸ’¡ Projects
While my undergrad education helped me to hone my design and manufacturing skills - with several research-heavy projects in my junior and senior years - my Masterâ€™s education at Columbia University has proven to be invaluable. Iâ€™ve had the fortune to work on some truly ground-breaking and inspiring projects while meeting many influential and creative individuals along the way.
